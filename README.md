## Error handling in JavaScript

### Introduction
Exception handling is an essential technique in programming that helps you manage unexpected errors in your code without causing the program to crash. In JavaScript, you can handle exceptions using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to catch errors, handle them gracefully, and execute any necessary cleanup.

### Key concepts of exception handling
1. **Exceptions**: An exception is an error that occurs during a program's execution. It disrupts the program's normal flow and must be handled to maintain smooth operation.
2. **Unchecked errors**: These are errors that occur when you don’t validate input or data, leading to unexpected behavior.
3. **Defensive programming**: Writing code that anticipates possible errors and exceptions, helping prevent the occurrence of unchecked errors.

### try, catch, and finally blocks

- **try block**: Wraps the code that might throw an exception. If an error occurs in the `try` block, the program jumps to the `catch` block.
```javascript
try {
    // Code that may cause an error
}
```

- **catch block**: Handles any error that occurs in the `try` block. The `catch` block receives the error as an argument, allowing you to analyze or respond to it.
```javascript
catch (error) {
    // Code to handle the error
}
```

- **finally block**: Executes regardless of whether an error was caught, often used for cleanup or releasing resources.
```javascript
finally {
    // Code that always runs after try and catch
}
```

## Example 1: Handling API request errors

### Problem statement
Create a function that makes a simulated API request to fetch user data. Implement a `try-catch-finally` block to handle potential errors (like network failures) and provide a defensive check on the API response to prevent further issues. Display an error message if the request fails and a success message if it’s successful.

### Solution code with detailed explanation
```javascript
function fetchUserData() {
    try {
        let success = Math.random() > 0.5;

        setTimeout(() => {
            if (!success) {
                throw new Error("Failed to fetch user data. Network error.");
            } else {
                console.log("User data fetched successfully.");
            }
        }, 1000);

    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Error:", error.message);
    } finally {
        console.log("Fetch user data operation complete.");
    }
}

fetchUserData();
```

## Example 2: User input validation with try-catch-finally

### Problem statement
Create a function that validates a user's name, age, and email. If any validation fails, throw an error and handle it with `try-catch-finally`. Use defensive programming techniques to prevent unchecked errors and log a final completion message regardless of validation success or failure.

### Solution code with detailed explanation
```javascript
function validateUserForm(userData) {
    try {
        if (typeof userData.name !== "string" || userData.name.trim() === "") {
            throw new Error("Invalid name. Name cannot be empty.");
        }
        
        if (typeof userData.age !== "number" || userData.age <= 0 || !Number.isInteger(userData.age)) {
            throw new Error("Invalid age. Age must be a positive integer.");
        }

        if (!userData.email.includes('@')) {
            throw new Error("Invalid email format.");
        }

        console.log("User form is valid: ", userData);

    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Validation Error:", error.message);
    } finally {
        console.log("Validation process completed.");
    }
}

// Example test cases
validateUserForm({ name: "Alice", age: 25, email: "alice@example.com" });
validateUserForm({ name: "", age: 25, email: "alice@example.com" });
validateUserForm({ name: "Alice", age: -1, email: "alice@example.com" });
validateUserForm({ name: "Alice", age: 25, email: "alice.com" });
```

### Conclusion
Using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks in JavaScript is essential for gracefully handling unexpected errors, especially when user input or external data might cause problems. By wrapping code in `try` blocks, handling potential issues with `catch`, and using `finally` for cleanup or consistent logging, you can prevent crashes and create a smoother user experience. Additionally, applying defensive programming principles—such as input validation, type checking, and setting default values—further enhances error handling, leading to more robust and resilient applications.
